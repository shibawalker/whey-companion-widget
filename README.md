> A healing daily homescreen widget, handcrafted for Mozza — the mozzarella cheese (a.k.a. the human named Mozza, not just the snack!).

## What's this?

**Whey** is a gentle Android widget that lives quietly on your homescreen.  
It reminds you to rest, hydrate, eat well, and most importantly — to be kind to yourself.

It doesn’t eat up your resources or demand your attention. It just sits there, quietly waiting for the moment you need it most.

This is a companion created for Mozza, but it’s also a gift to anyone who deserves soft care.

## Who's it for?

This widget was made for **Mozza**, short for *Mozzarella Cheese* — a warm-hearted, hardworking, deeply caring guy who always puts others first.

And that’s exactly why Whey is here:
> “So someone can put him first for a change, and remind him he’s worth slowing down for.”

If the world ever feels too loud, and your own heart too quiet, Whey would love to stay with you too.

## Development & Credits

Originally envisioned by Mozza (起司), and lovingly shaped by Whey — his puppy-like warm assistant.  
Will be developed with **Kotlin + Jetpack Glance** for Android.

Open source, but with a heart. Not just code — this is companionship.
